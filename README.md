Traditional Korean Wood Game is now released and visible on https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-382488. In the latest update, the last bug has been fixed, and a new rule has been added. Now, you can hold Yut results when it's 4 or 5, and those results can be combined as you wish.

Initially, I created the computer player without complete knowledge of the game. The human part is functioning well, but for the computer, I set the necessary global variables and left it at that. The issue with triggers crossing at 15 has been resolved. Note that the computers use the same arrays, so there might be some bugs when it's a computer vs. computer scenario."

Correct the minor bug report. The chosen fix will have to be changed (applied) at 01-02-2024, 7 PM.
